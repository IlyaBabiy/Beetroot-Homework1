                    <p>My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. I love
                    to draw and all that is connected with design. In this
                    area a long time ago and during this time I managed to
                    create several successful projects used by people all
                    over the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I
                    see it, people, it's like my work. Naturally do not want
                    to rest on our laurels and will continue further studies
                    to improve soybean skills, creating new interesting
                    creative projects.

                        <p>Lately, I often create templates for WordPress. The
                        portfolio is the presentation and the opportunity to
                        buy them on the site Themeforest.

                        <p>Creating a brand is very complex process aimed at the
                        creation and positioning the unique persons of the
                        company, its products and services.

                        is able to create it. I try to help people in its
                        definition as a person and specialist.
